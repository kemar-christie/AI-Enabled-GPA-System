# AI-Enabled-GPA-System


**DESCRIPTION** /n
The University of Technology is desirous of having a program created using Python and Prolog. The
program run will be carried out by the Innovate10X robot. The program will facilitate the generation
of reports/alerts that provide information regarding students who are close to having a GPA of 2.0. A
current undergraduate student who has a cumulative GPA of below 2.0 at the end of an academic year
will be placed on Academic Probation.
The GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) is a quantitative measure of a studentâ€™s performance. It is the
average obtained by dividing the sum of the product of grade point and credit for each module by the
total number of credits attempted.
